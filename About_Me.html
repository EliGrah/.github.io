                Hi o/
                <!-- Having lost my father when I was 16, and being kicked out of my house when I was 18, 
                I had a rough start coming out of highschool and for several years ended up working retail, stagnating in life.
                Thanks to some incredibly generous individuals who believed in me when I didn't, I received a 2 year scholarship 
                for Red Rocks Community College when I was 21 years old.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a non-traditional student I transferred to CU Boulder 2 years ago after graduating from RRCC with an associates. Since starting at RRCC I have switched my major 6 times, having originally started out studying
                English. I am now persuing a major in Creative Technology and Design in the College of Engineering and 
                have no plans on changing my major again. I am also currently completing a minor for Computer Science. I am hoping to eventually enter into a career as a backend code developer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having grown up with hardships, learning how to survive on my own from an early age, and 
                gaining experience working with and leading several teams throughout my years working in retail,
                I have learned how to be a teamplayer, work hard, and push through the tough times. No matter the company 
                I join, I know that I will be able to have a positive and significant impact in both their team
                as well as product. -->
