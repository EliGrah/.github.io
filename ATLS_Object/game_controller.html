            <h3>Part 1: Creating new Arduino Code</h3>
            <p>Using my previous controller from the <a href="Interactive_Box.html">Interactive Box Lab</a>, I was in a good spot
                to have an easy time with this lab due to the fact that my inputs were coming from an analog stick, a staple for controlling
                video games. I decided to only use the x and y potentiometer inputs and disregard the button input. For my arduino code, 
                <a href="https://gist.github.com/EliGrah/b492406bdca975060785b1792dea23c2">Link found here</a>, I took my previous made arduino code
                and simplified it down to only be taking my two inputs and printing them into the serial port in the desired format for p5.js.

            <p>Pictured is the original circuit I made for my interactive box. While the inputs and outputs are all still connected,
                I'm only going to be using my A0, and A1 ports for this lab. After confirming that I was getting good results and feedback in my
                serial port for the x and y potienometers in my analog stick, I moved on to creating the program in p5.js.

            <h3>Part 2: Creating the p5.js Code</h3>
            <p>After creating the basic structure of the p5 code using the resouces given to us for reading the arduino input 
                and translating it into information we can use to control our game, I started working on creating the actual game.
                I borrowed heavily from an already existing example for p5. I used the <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-snake-game.html">snake game example</a>,
                written by Prashant Gupta, for the basis of my code. Pictured is what the original making of the game looked like. Using the 
                jkli keys on your keyboard, you could control the snake.

        </div>
        <div class="item-1">
        <h3>Making the code my own</h3>
        <p>First I replaced the input for the game with the inputs from my controller. Instead of jkli you would instead move the analog
            stick to change the direction of the snake. Moving the analog stick up would make the snake go up, moving the stick down makes the snake go down, and so on and so forth. Next, I changed
            the graphics to make it more reminiscent of how I remember snake, playing it on old flip phones. I did this by changing the colors
            into a green color and made the text more retro. I also wanted to add my own twist to the game code so I created special fruits that would 
            pop up for the snake to eat that would give extra points.

        <h3>The Final Product</h3>
        <p>Lots of troubleshooting later and I have a finished snake game fully compatible with my controller! Check out the 
            video of it in action and view the source code <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/EliGrah/sketches/BFOFNA6tc">here</a>.
            Thank you!
