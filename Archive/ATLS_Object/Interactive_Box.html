            <h3>Part 1: Variable Input & Output</h3>
            <p>I decided to use an analog stick for my input, so I incorporated 
                this into my initial test build. To the right you can see the original
                schematic I made to connect and test everything.

            <p>Pressing the button on the analog stick would turn the LED off while held down.
                The Y-axis controlled the brightness of one LED and the X-axis controlled the other.

            <h3>Part 2: Interactive Sensor Box</h3>
            <p>After going through many different designs and ideas. I decided to go with 3 LED strips connected to 
                different inputs. To the right you can see the different connections on the arduino board
                I did. The official circuit design would look very similar to the original schematic in part 1, just with new
                LEDS.

        <div class="item-1">
            <p>As the analog stick is rotated it will change one LED strips color. It has access to the 
                full RGB range. Clicking the analog stick will save the color on the current LED strip and move 
                to changing the next LED strip. The code for this can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/EliGrah/8a160ccb1088e04a5e4c1e7361c567d4">found here</a>.

            <h3>Creating the Box</h3>
            <p>The original plan was to 3d print a box, unfortunately due to long print times
                and having to redesign certain parts of the box, this ended up not working out. So
                I used the next best thing, and spray painted a small carboard box. After cutting some holes
                and placing all the guts inside. The final design was done!

            <h3>The Guts</h3>
            <p>The analog stick is connected directly to the bread board. I used the adhesive on the breadboard
                to stick it to the back of the box to keep it in place. The actual Arduino board floats in the middle of
            the box. The LED stips are connected with adhesive to the top of the box. </p>
