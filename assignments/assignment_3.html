    <h1>Penguins</h1>
    <p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae are a group of aquatic flightless birds. <br>
        They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. <br>
        Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. <br>
        Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming. <br>
        A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.<br>
        They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.<br>
        <br>
        The largest living species is the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forster). On average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). <br>
        The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). <br>
        Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. <br>
        Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. <br>
        There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, <br>
        during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>The word penguin first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins <br>
            in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, and named them after this bird, <br>
            although they are not closely related. <br>
            <br>
            The etymology of the word penguin is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, Breton or Spanish origin <br>
            (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin), but first appears in English or Dutch. <br>
            <br>
            Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, "head" and gwyn, "white", including the Oxford English Dictionary, <br>
            the American Heritage Dictionary, the Century Dictionary and Merriam-Webster, on the basis that the name was originally <br>
            applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh: Pen Gwyn) in Newfoundland, or because <br>
            it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black). <br>
            <br>
            An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis, which means "fat" or "oil". Support for this etymology can be found <br>
            in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, fettgans or "fat-goose", and the related Dutch word vetgans. <br>
            <br>
            Adult male penguins are called cocks, females are hens; a group of penguins on land is a waddle, and a group of penguins in the water is a raft.</p>

        <h3>Systematics and evolution</h3>
        <h4><b>Living and recently exctint species</b></h4>
        <p>
            The number of extinct penguin species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, <br>
            all in the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some sources consider the white-flippered penguin a separate Eudyptula species, while others treat it as a <br>
            subspecies of the little blue penguin; the actual situation seems to be more complicated. Similarly, it is still unclear whether the <br>
            royal penguin is a separate species or merely a color morph of the macaroni penguin. The status of the rockhopper penguins is also unclear. <br>

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4><b>Breeding</b></h4>
        <p>
            Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland species; <br>
            these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred thousand in the case of king, <br>
            macaroni and chinstrap penguins. Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, <br>
            which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species. Agonistic displays are those <br>
            intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.<br>
            <br>
            Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. <br>
            Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king penguins, lay only one. <br>
            With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation duties. These incubation <br>
            shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea. <br>

    <div id="conserv_status">
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>
            The majority of living penguin species have declining populations. <hr>
            According to the IUCN Red List, their conservation statuses range from Least Concern through to Endangered. <hr>
